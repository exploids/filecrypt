usage.description = Encrypts or decrypts a file.
verbose = Print a lot of stuff to the console.
decrypt = Decrypt the given file. Omit this option to encrypt the file.
insecure = Allow the use of insecure parameters.
file = The input file. If this option is omitted, the standard input will be used.
output = The output file. If this option is omitted, an output file is automatically selected. If the option is given, but no file is given, the standard output will be used.
metadata = The file to use for metadata.
cipher-key = The key for the cipher.
mac = Apply and verify the file contents using a MAC. When decrypting, the MAC calculated during encryption must be given.
mac-algorithm = The MAC algorithm to use. Must be one of: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
mac-key = The key for the MAC.
key-file = The key file. The private keys will be read from and written to this file.
key-size = The key size. This size will be used, if a new key is generated.
algorithm = The algorithm to use. Must be one of: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
block-mode = The block mode to use. Must be one of: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
padding = The padding to use. Must be one of: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
password = The password to use for encryption.
iv = The initialization vector to use. If an IV is required, but not given, a new one will be generated automatically.
iv.0 = IMPORTANT: Never encrypt multiple files using the same initialization vector!
other.check.algorithm.secure = The algorithm (%s) is considered secure.
other.check.algorithm.insecure = The algorithm (%s) is considered insecure and should not be used.
other.check.padding.secure = The padding (%s) is considered secure.
other.check.padding.insecure = The padding (%s) can cause problems and should not be used.
other.check.iv.given = The IV (%s) may have been used for encrypting a previous file. Please make sure you use a fresh IV for every file you encrypt.
