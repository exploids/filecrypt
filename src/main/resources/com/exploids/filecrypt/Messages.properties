usage.description = Encrypts or decrypts a file.
encrypt.usage.description = Encrypts the file.
decrypt.usage.description = Decrypts the file.
check.usage.description = Checks, if the encryption parameters raise security concerns.
verbose = Print a lot of stuff to the console.
input = The input file. If omitted, the standard input will be used. This is especially useful, if you want to pipe data into filecrypt.
output = The output file. If omitted, the standard output will be used. This is especially useful, if you want to pipe the output from filecrypt to somewhere else.
metadata = The file to use for metadata. If no file is given, the metadata will be bundled into a TAR-archive along with the encrypted data.
key = The key.
key-file = The key file. The key will be read from/written to this file.
key-size = The key size. This size will be used, if a new key is generated.
algorithm = The algorithm to use: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}. (Default: ${DEFAULT-VALUE})
block-mode = The block mode to use: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}. (Default: ${DEFAULT-VALUE})
padding = The padding to use: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}. (Default: ${DEFAULT-VALUE})
initialization-vector = The initialization vector to use. If an IV is required, but not given, a new one will be generated automatically.
initialization-vector.0 = IMPORTANT: Never encrypt multiple files using the same initialization vector!
other.check.algorithm.secure = The algorithm (%s) is considered secure.
other.check.algorithm.insecure = The algorithm (%s) is considered insecure and should not be used.
other.check.padding.secure = The padding (%s) is considered secure.
other.check.padding.insecure = The padding (%s) can cause problems and should not be used.
other.check.iv.given = The IV (%s) may have been used for encrypting a previous file. Please make sure you use a fresh IV for every file you encrypt.
