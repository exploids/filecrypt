usage.description = Encrypts or decrypts a file.
debug = Print additional info to the console.
decrypt = Decrypt the given file. Omit this option to encrypt the file.
insecure = Allow the use of insecure parameters.
file = The input file.
output = The output file. If this parameter is omitted, an output file is automatically selected.
metadata = The file to use for metadata.
cipher-key = The key for the cipher.
verification = Verify the file contents using a MAC/hash. When decrypting, the MAC/hash calculated during encryption must be given.
verification-algorithm = The MAC/hash algorithm to use. Must be one of: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
verification-key = The key for the MAC.
key-file = The key file. The private keys will be read from and written to this file.
key-size = The key size. This size will be used, if a new key is generated.
algorithm = The algorithm to use. Must be one of: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
block-mode = The block mode to use. Must be one of: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
padding = The padding to use. Must be one of: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
password = The password to use for encryption.
password-algorithm = The algorithm to use for processing the password.
password-cost = The cost factor for the password algorithm. Higher values increase security.
password-block-size = The block size used for the password algorithm. Higher values increase security.
password-parallelization = The parallelization factor for the password algorithm. Higher values increase security.
password-salt = The salt for the password algorithm.
iv = The initialization vector to use. If an IV is required, but not given, a new one will be generated automatically.
iv.0 = IMPORTANT: Never encrypt multiple files using the same initialization vector!
signature = Signs and verifies the file contents.
signature-private-key = The private key to use for the signature.
signature-public-key = The public key to use for the signature.
